# Weather-Forecast

## Description
This project uses Open Weather Map API alongside Javascript, HTML and CSS and Bootstrap to create a weather page displaying a search input box for a user to input the city weather they would like to search. This search is stored in local storage and I have limited the city search to 5 cities with no repeats. Once a city is entered the user will receive current weather and forecast for thenext five days.

## Usage
This project is useful as it gives the user current weather in real time. If a user is travelling they can check the weather for any city in the world and make appropiate plans. I found this project challenging with regards to the styling the appended elements, so it can be useful practise for anyone wanting some exercise in styling these elements.
